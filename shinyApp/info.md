#### About

Medicare is the US government organization for medical care. They provide a lot of data about healthcare (providers), hospitals, physicians and more. <br>
The 'Hospital Compare' data allow you to compare the quality of care at over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals across the country. We wanted to put the data in a format so that people can make a better decision on where they decide to seek healthcare.
