### Application purpose

Medicare is the US government organization for medical care. They provide a lot of data about healthcare (providers), hospitals, physicians and more. I wanted to put the data in a format so that people can make a better decision on where they decide to seek healthcare.


#### Application properties

* The data is retrieved from Medicare and is only about infections.
* The data is stored in a sqlite database.
